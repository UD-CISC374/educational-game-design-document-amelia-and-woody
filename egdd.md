# Game Name
To recycle or not to recycle?

## Elevator Pitch

The United States Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 75% of American waste stream is recyclable but we only recycle about 30% of it. You will learn about the types of recycling with its associated color and what is acceptable in each category. Save the planet one can at a time. 


## Influences (Brief)

- *Influence #1*:
  - Medium: Johns Hopkins University
  - Explanation: Each trashcan is separated into three containers (green for recycling, yellow for compost, and gray for incineration).
- *Influence #2*:
  - Medium: Personal knowledge/experiences
  - Explanation: We were not taught the different types of recycling and also the University of Delaware does not practice categorizes waste. 


## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- Different Trash type.(Recycle/chemical/Disposable/Non-Disposable)
